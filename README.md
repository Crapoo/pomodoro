# Pomodoro
Pomodoro Technique app for Android

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method using a timer to break down work into 25-minute-long intervals, separated by short breaks.

To read more about it, go check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## How to use the app?
It's really easy.

- To start the timer, click inside the circle, on the timer itself (and then, go to work!).
- To pause the timer for whatever reason, just click on it again. 
- To reset the timer, press and hold until the phone vibrates, then you can decide to restart (or not).

Once the timer runs off, the vibrator will remind you it's time to take a break.

## Screenshots please?
Sure, here they are:

## Where do I get it?
If you're a developer, feel free to grab the sources from this repo.

If you're not, I'll add a link to download it from the PlayStore as soon as it hits a releasable state.


## What's left before a release?
There are still a few things to do before a first release :

- [ ] Add intro activity to quickly explain how the app works.
- [ ] Add toast when the timer runs off.
- [ ] Add notification while the timer is on.
