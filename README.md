# Pomodoro
Pomodoro Technique app for Android

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method using a timer to break down work into 25-minute-long intervals, separated by short breaks.

To read more about it, go check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## How to use the app?
It's really easy.

Once the app is launched, all you have to do is click anywhere within the circle. This will start the time and you can then start working.

Once the timer runs off, the vibrator will remind you it's time to take a break.

## Screenshots please?
Sure, here they are:
